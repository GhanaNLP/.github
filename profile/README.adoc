- We are currently working on research project that improve machine translation, speech syhthesis and speech recognition for African languages
Our community is made up of over 500 contributers who support several projects on a voluntary basis. We believe in community driven projects that drive innovation in natural language processing for Ghanaian languages. 

You can join our community by sending a request via email - natural.language.processing.gh@gmail.com. Our community meetings are shared via our Youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/@ghananlp.
